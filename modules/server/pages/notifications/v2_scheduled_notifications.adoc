The `v2/scheduled_notifications` endpoint allows for the creation of Schedules in Teak. Schedules will be displayed in the list of Schedules for the game in the Teak Dashboard and may be managed by Dashboard users.

This endpoint is generally preferred over the Direct Notification Scheduling endpoint.

This endpoint is appropriate for use when the users a notification should be sent to can be defined by an audience, or when a notification needs to be scheduled more than 30 days in advance.
