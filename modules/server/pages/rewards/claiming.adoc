= Claiming Teak Rewards

Depending on your needs reward claiming can be done through your game client **or** your game server.

== Client Integration

When the game loads, if there is a teak_reward_id present in the query parameters of the game URL, then the user should be granted a reward. You can start the reward flow by calling ``window.teak.claimReward(callback)``. This call must be made **after** calling ``window.teak.identify()``.

Our SDK will make a call into the Teak backend to confirm that user is eligible to receive this reward. If so, two things will happen simultaneously

* The callback given will be called
* Teak will make a POST request to your backend as described in our :doc:`endpoint` documentation.

The callback will be passed a single object parameter of the following form::
[source, json]
----
{
  "metadata" : {
    "serverVersion": "",
    "serverId": "",
    "requestId": "",
    "requestTime": "",
    "code": 200
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : "",
    "reward" : ""
  }
}
----

``response.status`` will be one of the following:

grant_reward:: The user has been issued this reward by Teak
self_click:: The user has attempted to claim a reward from their own social post
already_clicked:: The user has already been issued this reward
too_many_clicks: :The reward has already been claimed its maximum number of times globally
exceed_max_clicks_for_day:: The user has already claimed their maximum number of rewards of this type for the day
expired:: This reward has expired and is no longer valid
invalid_post:: Teak does not recognize this reward id

If ``response.status`` is ``grant_reward`` then response.reward will be a JSON encoded object of the form ``{"internal_id" : quantity, "another_internal_id" : anotherQuantity}``. If ``response.status`` is any other value, the ``response.reward`` key will not be present.

Teak **does not** provide any in game UI. It is up to the game to inform users of the reward they were issued or why the reward was not granted.

== Server integration

The server integration is identical to the client integration, except the reward flow is started by making a POST request to:

    https://rewards.gocarrot.com/<<teak_reward_id>>/clicks?clicking_user_id=<<your_user_id>>

This endpoint will respond with a status of 200 if the user has been granted the reward and a status of 403 if the user has not been granted the reward. The response body will be identical to the response passed to the callback in the client integration.
