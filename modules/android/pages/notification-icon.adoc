= Android Notification Icon Assets

To make sure that your notification icons show up properly on API 21+ you should use https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/[Android Asset Studio] to process, and create the needed resolutions for the icon.

Click on the https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-notification.html#source.type=image&source.space.trim=1&source.space.pad=0&name=icon_white[Notification icon generator tool], and you will see this screen:

Drag your notification icon onto the page, and set the name (bottom left) to the value you use for ``io_teak_small_notification_icon``, then click on the Download Zip button in the top right corner.

For this example the name of the icon is ``icon_white``

The zip file should contain:

* ``drawable-mdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``drawable-hdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``drawable-xhdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``drawable-xxhdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``drawable-xxxhdpi/icon_white.png``

Copy all of these directories into your ``res/`` directory. Your Android app should now have:

* ``res/drawable-mdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``res/drawable-hdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``res/drawable-xhdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``res/drawable-xxhdpi/icon_white.png``
* ``res/drawable-xxxhdpi/icon_white.png``

This notification icon would be specified in ``res/values-v21/teak.xml`` as:

.res/values-v21/teak.xml
[source,xml]
